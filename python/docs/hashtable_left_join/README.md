Arguments: two arrays
Return: a list

### Whiteboard Process

![Two Arrays]()

### Approach and Efficiency

The time is O(n+m) due to the two lists of integers that are input.
The solution has to iterate through each input list and the time will depend on the size of the input list.

The space is O(n+m) due to the dictionary that we will use to store each of the integers in the input lists.
The approach stores each integer.

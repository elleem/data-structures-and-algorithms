## Reverse a List

Write a function called `BinarySearch` which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted list, and the search key.

Be sure to use the binary search method in your algorithm.

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the list's element that is equal to the value of the search key or -1 if the element is not in the array.
